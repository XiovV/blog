# Game hacking introduction

In this section of the blog I will be documenting my game hacking learning journey. We will be playing around with Cheat Engine, Assembly, Debuggers, writing cheats with Go and C++, kernel-mode and user-mode anti cheats and a whole bunch of other stuff I come across. 

!!! warning
    This blog aims to teach the essentials of game hacking, but please don't go and ruin other people's fun with your cheats!

## Why?
For quite some time now I've wanted to start programming on a lower level, go beyond web development, learn how the operating systems and programs we use on a daily basis work. But why game hacking? Game cheats are one of those things that have fascinated me since I was a child, and as developing cheats for games requires deep understanding of the things I've just mentioned, it seems like the perfect way to learn everything I want to learn.

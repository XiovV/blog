# Introduction to multi-level pointers (work in progress)

## What are multi-level pointers?
Multi-level pointers (MLPs) are actually really simple, as tricky and complicated as they might seem when you first start learning about them (don't worry if you're struggling, I did too). MLPs are just pointers pointing to other pointers, it's essentially a chain of pointers. It should make more sense after taking a look at the example below.
